Requires:
- newly build satos-image that can be uploaded to hawkbit (satos/release/satos-rpi4-64-dev-20240214-22e978a68e-ota.raucb)
- access to the Disco-Satupdater (disco-satupdater.cs.rptu.de)

1. create a new update in hawkbit
	- open "upload management" (via the left side bar)
	- create new software module (the "+" in the middle window)
		- Type: OS
		- Name: SatosRPI4 (for SatOS of a Raspberry Pi 4)
		- version:
			1.0.0: base version
			1.0.3: uses Jason-Web-Tokens for sensor authentication
			1.0.4: enable remote configurations, reboot, bugfix iridium_sniffing
			----- planed -----
			1.1.0: use job-id for identification instead job-name
			2.0.0: generic remote execution environment, privacy features, chunk-based uploads
			----- system -----
			x.y.z: 	x=Major version (big features work stable [definitely break website compatibility]) 
				y=minor version (parts of a major feature or minor improvements [likely to break website compactability]) 
				z=roling number (bugfixes, tests of features [should not break website compactability])
		- vendor: <your name> (z.B. Eric Jedermann)
		- description: <description from the version>
	- Upload an artifact for the new software module
		- drag and drop the new satos-image (or use the upload button) in the lower right window
		- wait until the upload window pops up and the upload is finished
	- open "distributions management" (via the left side bar)
	- create a new distribution for the new satos-version (the "+" in the left-middle window)
		- Type: OS with app(s)
		- Name: SatosRPI4 (for SatOS of a Raspberry Pi 4)
		- version: <same as the software module>
		- description: <same as the software module>
	- drag and drop the software module (from the right-middle window) on the distribution (in the left-middle window)
		- ensure & confirm that you assigned the correct software module to the correct distribution

2. manaully apply a update to a sensor
	- open "deployment management" (via the left side bar, this is the starting webpage)
	- drag and drop a distribution (from the middle window) to a sensor (on the left window)
		- selsct "forced" to directly update the sensor and apply the update
		- ensure & confirm that you used the correct distribution and sensor
	- the sensor status changes from a green checkmark to a yellow half-moon
	- wait until the update is performed (takes a few minutes)
	- when everything works fine, the sensor status changes back to a green checkmark
