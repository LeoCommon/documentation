# DiscoSAT Documentation
This is the automatic documentation builder for DiscoSAT.
It imports documentations from all subprojects and provides them in one central instance.
This is achieved through the use of [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) and the [mkdocs-multirepo-plugin](https://github.com/jdoiro3/mkdocs-multirepo-plugin).

Refer to `docs/index.md` and then build the docs for more!
